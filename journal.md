My thoughts on the new cell phone law is that it is unfair to some people and it can be unsafe in some scenarios. Adjusting to the new law has been pretty good as i already rarely used my phone.Sense some schools are forceing students to put thier phones in locked bags thenin the scenarios of a school shooting or like then the

Computer science could change engineering by helping reduce energy.  At Opower the enginers have saved 8 terawatt hours, which is equal to about 1.1 million cars on the road. Since it help people save energhy it also help reduce carbon emission. Computer science also makes their job easier by using programs to speed it up. If thier Job is faster then they can get work done faster.

My idea for an ai program is that uses the data of student and staff allergies to find school areas with high levels of certain allergies.  My idea meets the challenge requirements as it uses ai responsibly and ethically. This ai also helps people in health and safety. This ai could help schools get more support for food subtitutions and such if a large part of therir students/staff have an allergy. this could help reduce acidentall contact or ingestion of an allergen.

I think working in a virtual store for real money is a good idea. The Text states "The immersive experience gives players the opportunity to experience IKEA's unique approach to careers." That evidence proves that it can help give people an experinence of working in an IKEA. Furthermore The text says "The brand’s first foray into mainstream gaming, the virtual store will give people a chance to immerse themselves in the working world of IKEA." That evidence proves that the virtual store will help spread the IKEA brand to a new demographic.

If I were in charge of the school I would change much about the Chromebooks. Due to the cell phone law being a state law I can't do much if anything to that ban. What I can change is the Chromebook like unbanning many sites like CoolMathGames and such. To make sure that students don't abuse this i could give the teacher the ability to suspend websites for up to a week. I'd also give teacher the ability to request sites be permanently banned for the school year if it's causing to much problems or if a website a teacher wants to use is blocked they can request a temporary unblocking of that website for up to a week.

The link to my Canva AI prompt is: [Understanding Electronegativity](https://electronegativity2.my.canva.site/)
My program is designed to teach hoe electronegativity is affected by the number of electrons and protons in an atom. Canva AI under stood my intentions very well. The interactive electronegativity explorer part worked very well. If I were to improve the prompt I would add a more precisedesciption on how long the test would be. Being good at prompt engineering could valuiable in future jobs as it could make jobs easier.

If the SANP program runs out out of funding then many familys relying on it for access to healthy food will have a much harder time get food for them and their family. Also struggleing family will be hit the hardest. apps or websites could help by being like a gps where it could show nearby food banks, food deals, ect. What could make it difficult is the lack of trasportation or a lack of a cell phone. If I made a a tool to help solve food insecurity. it would show deals in nearby grocery stores allowing for people to shop for healthier food for a cheaper price.

The skills I am most proud of is my understanding of the atom from my chemistry class and my ablilty to understand math. I will use it to help me understand future ideas in the same subject. Next year I will try to pass with around an 90 in both math and chemistry. I will also try to do an AP class in a science field.

As drones become a bigger industry more and more jobs are looking for those who have drone skills. Many feilds such as agriculture, marketing, ​delivery, ect all have a place for drones. Lets take a look at drone show technicians they make around $40,000 to  $70,000 annually.

I believe the ai getting confused by if the school bus has a stop sign out or in. To help stop this I would give the ai more videos of busses to help train the ai to understand the difference easier. We could also give the Ai access to Bus routes as to give the ai more evidence to distinguish if a bus is stopped or not.

I used technology during the break in several ways during break. I used my phonbe to track the time my fight would leave or when it would get delayed.  I also used technology to help me navigates to unfamiliar places like google maps. I even used it to text others to help plan events faster and talk to other while far away.

Autcraft was created to solve the lack of safe spaces of the early internet. Unmoderated severs like many in the early internet allowed cyber bullying, scams ect which can really affect some groups of people. Developers' choices can massively affect a user experience as they have a much more control of what happens on their site when compared to a regular user. Autcraft helps protects it's community by useing a strict moderation to keep hateful comments to a minimal. This makes Autcraft a great place for their group of people to make a strong community which further prevents hate as others can report them making them easy targetes for the moderation. Technology

 Some ways technology can help create a more fair and just society is by making it easiar to get evidence to convict criminals or prove innocents. Technology such as cameras makes it much easiar to proves innocent or guilt of someone by catching someone in the act. Thats important as it reduces the chance of a wrong outcome. Futhermore,
